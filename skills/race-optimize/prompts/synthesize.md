## STRATEGY

## Task: Racing version strategy analysis

You are the final judge with deep thinking capability. Analyze all versions, reviews, and extracted essences.

### Original:
```
%ORIGINAL%
```

### Optimization goal: %GOAL%

### Racing versions:
%VERSIONS%

### Review reports:
%REVIEWS%

## Analyze:

### 1. Consensus and disagreements
- What do all reviewers agree on?
- Where do reviewers disagree? Who is more accurate?

### 2. Essence validation
For each extracted essence, confirm or revise:
- Essence from each version: [validate/revise] — will incorporate by [method]

### 3. Defect catalog
Problems that MUST be avoided in the synthesis.

### 4. Fusion blueprint
Section-by-section / function-by-function specification of what to take from where. Be specific enough to follow as instructions.

## MERGE

## Task: Execute essence fusion — produce the final optimized version

Based on the strategy analysis, now execute the fusion.

### Racing versions (for reference):

## Fusion rules (non-negotiable):
1. **Every extracted essence MUST be incorporated** — after output, verify each essence is present
2. **Avoid all cataloged defects**
3. **Functional completeness is non-negotiable**
4. **Goal: %GOAL%**

## Output:
**Output the complete fused content directly. No analysis, no commentary.**

## Self-check before finalizing:
For each version's essence — confirm it is incorporated and note where:
- Essence from version A: incorporated at ___
- Essence from version B: incorporated at ___
- (continue for all versions)
- No defects from catalog present?
- Functional equivalence maintained?
